# 🚀 Spike: Integrate Existing Soroban Events into SubQuery

## 📋 Overview

This spike successfully integrates existing Soroban events emitted by the Trustless Work Smart Escrow contract into SubQuery. The indexer captures escrow lifecycle events without requiring any changes to the smart contract code.

## 🎯 Captured Events

The following events from the Trustless Work escrow contract are successfully indexed:

| Function | Event Topic | Payload | Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| `initialize_escrow` | `"init_esc"` | `()` (empty) | Escrow creation - minimal payload |
| `fund_escrow` | `"fund_esc"` | `(signer, amount)` | Includes signer and deposit amount |
| `release_funds` | `"dis_esc"` | `(signer, platform_address)` | Includes release signer and platform address |
| `update_escrow` | `"chg_esc"` | `(platform_address, engagement_id)` | Platform address and engagement ID |

## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### Schema Definition (`schema.graphql`)

```graphql
type EscrowEvent @entity {
  id: ID!
  type: String! @index
  contractId: String! @index
  engagementId: String
  payload: String
  ledger: BigInt! @index
  timestamp: BigInt! @index
}
```

### Event Handler Configuration (`project.ts`)

```typescript
{
  handler: "handleEscrowEvents",
  kind: StellarHandlerKind.Event,
  filter: {
    topics: [
      "init_esc", // Escrow initialization event
      "fund_esc", // Escrow funding event
      "dis_esc",  // Escrow funds release event
      "chg_esc",  // Escrow update event
    ],
    // Optionally add contractId if you want to filter by specific contract
    // contractId: "CONTRACT_ID_HERE"
  },
}
```

### Mapping Function

The `handleEscrowEvents` function processes all escrow events and:
- Extracts event type from the first topic element
- Creates unique event IDs using contract ID, ledger sequence, and event ID
- Attempts to extract engagement ID for update events
- Stores complete payload data as JSON
- Records ledger sequence and timestamp for indexing

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and Yarn installed
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Stellar CLI (optional, for testing)

### Installation

1. **Navigate to project:**
```bash
cd Indexer-Spikes/SubQuery-Soroban-Events/Stellar/soroban-testnet-starter
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
yarn install
```

3. **Generate types:**
```bash
yarn codegen
```

4. **Build project:**
```bash
yarn build
```

5. **Start services:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

6. **Verify all services are running:**
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

All services should show as "healthy" or "Up".

## 🔬 Testing with Trustless Work dApp

### Using the dApp

1. **Visit the dApp:** https://docs.trustlesswork.com/trustless-work/open-source-dapps/dapp-overview

2. **Setup Wallet:**
   - Connect Freighter wallet or compatible Stellar wallet
   - Ensure you have testnet XLM and USDC tokens

3. **Test Escrow Lifecycle:**
   - Deploy a test escrow (`initialize_escrow` → `init_esc` event)
   - Fund the escrow (`fund_escrow` → `fund_esc` event)
   - Update escrow configuration (`update_escrow` → `chg_esc` event)
   - Release funds (`release_funds` → `dis_esc` event)

### Querying Events

1. **Access GraphQL Playground:** Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

2. **Test basic connectivity:**
```graphql
query HealthCheck {
  escrowEvents(first: 1) {
    totalCount
  }
}
```

3. **View recent events:**
```graphql
query AllEscrowEvents {
  escrowEvents(first: 10, orderBy: TIMESTAMP_DESC) {
    nodes {
      id
      type
      contractId
      engagementId
      payload
      ledger
      timestamp
    }
    totalCount
  }
}
```

4. **Filter by event type:**
```graphql
query InitializationEvents {
  escrowEvents(filter: { type: { equalTo: "init_esc" } }) {
    nodes {
      id
      type
      contractId
      payload
      ledger
    }
  }
}
```

📝 **More sample queries:** See `test-queries.graphql` for additional examples.

### Option 3: Using Sample Queries File

The `test-queries.graphql` file contains pre-built queries for common use cases:
- Health checks
- Event filtering by type
- Contract-specific queries
- Time-based filtering

Copy any query from this file into the GraphQL Playground for immediate testing.

## ✅ What Works

- ✅ **Event Detection:** All four escrow event types are successfully captured
- ✅ **Data Indexing:** Events are stored with complete metadata in PostgreSQL  
- ✅ **GraphQL API:** Query interface provides real-time and historical event access
- ✅ **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support with generated types
- ✅ **Filtering:** Events can be filtered by type, contract ID, ledger, and timestamp
- ✅ **Docker Integration:** All services run reliably in containers
- ✅ **Clean Structure:** Organized codebase with only necessary components

## 🔧 Testing Challenges & Solutions

### Current Limitations
- **Event Payload Parsing:** Limited parsing of complex payload structures  
- **Engagement ID Extraction:** Only partially implemented for update events
- **Live Event Testing:** Requires working dApp interaction or manual contract calls

### Potential Enhancements
- **Rich Data Extraction:** Parse payload data into structured fields
- **Event Relationships:** Link related events by engagement ID
- **Real-time Subscriptions:** Add GraphQL subscriptions for live event updates
- **Contract Address Filtering:** Filter events by specific escrow contract addresses
- **Historical Data:** Import historical events from earlier blocks

## 🌟 Benefits

1. **Immediate Visibility:** No changes needed to existing smart contracts
2. **Real-time Indexing:** Events are indexed as they occur on-chain
3. **Historical Access:** Complete event history available via GraphQL
4. **Ecosystem Integration:** Other dApps can consume this indexed data
5. **Performance:** Fast queries via indexed PostgreSQL database

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Option 1: Immediate GraphQL Verification

1. **Open GraphQL Playground:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Run this health check query:**
   ```graphql
   query HealthCheck {
     escrowEvents(first: 1) {
       totalCount
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Expected result:** Should show `totalCount: 0` (or higher if events exist)

### Option 2: Test Scripts

We provide two test scripts for different scenarios:

#### `simple-test.js` - Basic Connectivity Test
```bash
cd Indexer-Spikes/SubQuery-Soroban-Events
node simple-test.js
```
This script tests:
- GraphQL endpoint connectivity
- Schema validation
- Basic query functionality

#### `test-escrow-script.js` - Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
cd Indexer-Spikes/SubQuery-Soroban-Events
node test-escrow-script.js
```
This script:
- Checks existing events in the indexer
- Creates a test Stellar account
- Provides guidance for dApp testing
- Simulates escrow interaction flows

**Note:** These scripts require `stellar-sdk` and `node-fetch` dependencies.

### Generate Test Events

1. **Visit Trustless Work dApp:** https://docs.trustlesswork.com/trustless-work/open-source-dapps/dapp-overview
2. **Connect Stellar wallet** (make sure it's on Testnet)
3. **Create any escrow interaction** (initialize, fund, update, or release)
4. **Return to GraphQL playground** and run:
   ```graphql
   query AllEscrowEvents {
     escrowEvents(first: 10, orderBy: TIMESTAMP_DESC) {
       nodes {
         id
         type
         contractId
         ledger
         timestamp
       }
       totalCount
     }
   }
   ```
5. **You should see new events** appearing in the results!
