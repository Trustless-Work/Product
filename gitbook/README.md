# 👋 Welcome

Trustless Work is **Escrow-as-a-Service (EaaS)** for **stablecoin escrow** (including **USDC escrow**). It lets you build **non-custodial escrow** flows with **milestone-based payments**.

You deploy and manage escrow smart contracts on **Stellar (Soroban)**. You integrate via the **Trustless Work API** and optional **React SDK**.

***

### What you can do with the Trustless Work escrow API

* Hold funds in escrow using **non-custodial smart contracts**.
* Add **programmable escrow logic** to your app or marketplace.
* Support **milestones**, approvals, releases, and **dispute resolution**.
* Configure **roles and permissions** for each signer.
* Ship faster without building escrow contracts from scratch.
