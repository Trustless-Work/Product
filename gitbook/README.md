## Welcome to Trustless Work Documentation!

**Trustless Work** is the escrow infrastructure for the new economy — a developer-first platform to integrate programmable, milestone-based fund releases into your product using stablecoins and smart contracts.

***

### 🧠 What You Can Do Here

With Trustless Work, you can:

* 💸 Hold funds securely in smart escrows
* ✅ Define who can mark milestones, approve work, or release funds
* ⚙️ Automate transactions using our API and React hooks
* 🔐 Stay non-custodial and audit-friendly

We abstract away the complexity of blockchain so you can focus on building.
