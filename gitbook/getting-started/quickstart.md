# Quickstart

Before you get started with Trustless Workâ€™s you need the following:

To sign transactions, you will need 1 (or more) Stellar wallets. Learn more here

To fund testnet escrows you will also need testnet XLM and testnet USDC. Learn more [here.](essential-tools.md)

#### **Step 1: Sign Up**

* Log in with your Stellar wallet on TW dApp: [dapp.trustlesswork.com](https://dapp.trustlesswork.com)
* Create your account at Trustless Work to access your API key.
* Choose between **testnet** for experimentation ~~or **mainnet** for production use.~~

#### **Step 2: Set Up Your Environment (for devs)**

* Use the SDKs or sample code provided in your preferred language.

#### **Step 3: Create Your First Escrow**

* You will need the escrow details (parties addresses, roles, info) before creating your first escrow. Learn more [here](../smart-escrow-design/)
* Initiate a smart escrow contract with minimal setup.

#### **Step 4: Test and Iterate**

* Use our **testnet** environment to experiment safely.
* Debug using the detailed responses and error codes in our API Reference.
