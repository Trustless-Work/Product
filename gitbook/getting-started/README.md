### 🧪 2. Design Your Escrow Lifecycle

Before deploying, define the **roles and responsibilities** within your escrow flow.

Use our [**Escrow Desig**](../smart-escrow-design/)**n Framework** to configure:

* Milestone markers
* Approvers
* Release signers
* Receivers

💡 Not sure how to structure it? Check our [use cases](../use-cases-unlocking-the-potential-of-smart-escrows/)

### **3. Deploy and test in our dApp**

We made a dApp to assist you on deploying escrows.  You can find it [here](https://d-app-trustless-work.vercel.app/).

To sign transactions, you will need 1 (or more) Stellar wallets. Learn more here

To fund testnet escrows you will also need testnet XLM and testnet USDC. Learn more [here.](essential-tools.md)
