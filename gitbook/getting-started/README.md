Welcome to **Trustless Work** — your gateway to programmable, secure, and non-custodial escrows powered by blockchain.

This guide is your launchpad whether you're:

### 🧪 2. Design Your Escrow Lifecycle

Before deploying, define the **roles and responsibilities** within your escrow flow.

Use our [**Escrow Desig**](../smart-escrow-design/)**n Framework** to configure:

* Milestone markers
* Approvers
* Release signers
* Receivers
