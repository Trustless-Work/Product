# Milestone-based Freelance & Contract Work

## Trustless Work Use Case: Freelance and Gig Economy

### Overview

Trustless Work enables secure, transparent, and reliable transactions between freelancers (service providers) and clients through blockchain-based smart escrows. By integrating Trustless Work’s API, gig platforms and freelance marketplaces can efficiently manage payments, reducing disputes, late payments, and fraud.

### Problem

Freelancers often experience delayed payments, disputes, and uncertainty regarding compensation. Clients risk losing deposits or receiving unsatisfactory work. Traditional escrow solutions are costly, slow, and lack transparency, undermining trust and operational efficiency.

### Solution

Trustless Work’s escrow infrastructure offers:

* Neutral holding of funds until project milestones are fulfilled.
* Clearly defined deliverables, timelines, and payment conditions agreed upon by clients and freelancers.
* Blockchain-based transparency for all transactions, ensuring accountability.
* Automatic payment release upon milestone approvals, minimizing administrative tasks.

### Workflow Example

#### 1. Initiation Phase

* The client (Alice) posts a gig and selects a freelancer (Bob).
* Both parties agree upon milestones and conditions.
* An escrow contract is initiated automatically via Trustless Work’s API.

#### 2. Funding Phase

* Alice deposits the agreed-upon payment into the escrow contract. Funds are securely stored on-chain.
* Bob receives confirmation once the funds are deposited.

#### 3. Milestone Update Phase

* Bob completes a milestone and updates its status to "Delivered" through the platform interface.

#### 4. Approval Phase

* Alice reviews the submitted milestone:
  * If satisfied, Alice marks it "Approved."
  * If unsatisfied, Alice initiates a dispute, prompting mediation by the platform or designated resolver.

#### 5. Release Phase

* Approved milestones automatically trigger the escrow contract to release funds to Bob.
* Trustless Work transparently deducts a small commission, recorded on the blockchain.

### Benefits

* **Freelancers:** Reliable and timely payments, reducing financial uncertainties.
* **Clients:** Secure and neutral handling of payments with full transparency.
* **Platforms:** Effortless escrow integration without developing proprietary escrow systems.

### Potential Integrations

* Freelance marketplaces and gig economy platforms.
