# Subscription + Performance-based Retainers

Trustless Work's Smart Escrow infrastructure provides a secure, transparent, and flexible way to manage subscription-based and performance-driven retainers. This model ensures ongoing service payments are securely held and released only upon meeting predefined performance criteria, providing confidence to both subscribers and service providers.

#### How it Works

**Roles Involved:**

* **Subscriber (Client):** Pays the retainer and approves milestones based on performance.
* **Service Provider:** Delivers ongoing services and marks milestones as complete.
* **Platform/Trustless Work Escrow:** Securely holds funds and facilitates transparent payment releases based on performance.

#### Escrow Lifecycle:

1. **Initiation Phase:**
   * Subscriber and service provider agree on a subscription retainer model, including regular payments and performance metrics (KPIs, deliverables).
   * Escrow contract created on Trustless Work, clearly outlining terms, milestones, and conditions for fund release.
2. **Funding Phase:**
   * Subscriber deposits funds monthly or quarterly into the escrow, securely holding payments for ongoing services.
3. **Performance and Milestone Updates:**
   * Service Provider regularly updates the status of performance milestones (e.g., monthly targets, deliverables, KPI achievement).
4. **Approval Phase:**
   * Subscriber reviews and approves milestones based on performance criteria.
   * If performance meets or exceeds agreed-upon KPIs, the subscriber approves milestone completion.
   * If performance criteria are not met, the subscriber can initiate a dispute or negotiate partial releases.
5. **Release Phase:**
   * Upon milestone approval, funds are automatically and transparently released to the service provider.
   * Partial or full fund releases can occur, depending on performance outcomes.
6. **Ongoing Subscription:**
   * The escrow resets each cycle (monthly or quarterly), maintaining ongoing secure payments aligned to service delivery and performance.

#### Benefits:

* **Trust and Transparency:** Payments linked directly to measurable performance, reducing risk for both parties.
* **Secure Funding:** Funds are safeguarded by blockchain-based escrow, mitigating disputes and improving trust.
* **Flexibility:** Customizable escrow conditions allow parties to define clear KPIs and flexible terms for performance-based payment adjustments.

#### Ideal Use Cases:

* **Marketing Agencies:** Monthly retainers tied to specific KPIs (e.g., traffic growth, conversions).
* **Freelance Consultants:** Retainer fees linked to tangible business outcomes (e.g., sales, lead generation).
* **Managed Services Providers:** Regular subscription payments tied to service uptime, SLA fulfillment, or other defined metrics.

Trustless Work's Subscription + Performance-based Retainers model empowers businesses to confidently engage ongoing services, ensuring mutual satisfaction and alignment through transparent, secure, and performance-driven payments.
