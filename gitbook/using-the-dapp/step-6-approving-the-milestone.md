Now that the milestone has been completed by the **service provider**, the **approver** needs to verify and approve it.

**1. Switch to the "Approver" tab**

* In the **escrows section**, navigate to the **Approver** tab.
* You will only see escrows where your logged-in wallet is assigned the **Approver** role.

**2. Click on the escrow to open the modal**

* Select the escrow where the milestone has been completed.
* The escrow should now show **100% Completed** in the milestone progress bar.

**3. Approve the milestone**

* You should now see a **blue  "Approve" button**.
* Click **"Approve"** to proceed with milestone approval.

**4. Sign the transaction**

* Just like previous actions, a transaction request will appear in your **wallet (Freighter)**.
* Review the details and **sign the transaction**.

**5. Escrow status update**

* After signing, the milestone should now show as **"Approved"**.
* The funds are still in escrow but are now ready for release.

Once you approve the milestone, we move on to the **final step: releasing the escrow funds**!

In the case of the single release escrows: all milestones must be approved for the release to be enabled. \
In the case of multi-release escrows: Approval at the milestone level is required to release a Milestone. &#x20;
