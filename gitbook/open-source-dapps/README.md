# üïç Open Source dApps

We have dApps that serve both as Open Source templates for you to build faster, but also as standalone dApps to interact with our escrows. : \


[Backoffice dApp:](backoffice-dapp-overview/) Great for using as a Backoffice or as standalone Escrow platform. The backoffice is the best for deploying and configuring escrows. Depending on the wallet used to login, the user will be able to interact with the contracts they play a role in.&#x20;

[demo dApp:](demo-overview/) Lean simple template that integrates with our SDK for a quick demo. Includes types, hooks, and everything you will need to get started.
