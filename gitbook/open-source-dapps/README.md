# üïç Open Source dApps

We build and maintain a suite of decentralized applications that serve a dual purpose:

* **Open-source templates** you can clone, extend, and integrate.
* **Standalone tools** you can use directly to interact with Trustless Work escrows.

Each dApp showcases a different layer of the Trustless Work ecosystem‚Äîfrom deployment to interaction to transparency.

### Backoffice dApp:

**Best for:** Deploying and configuring escrows

The [Backoffice dApp:](https://dapp.trustlesswork.com) Acts as your operational dashboard. You can create new escrows, define roles, set milestones, and manage approvals.\
Depending on the wallet used to log in, users will automatically see and interact with the escrows where they hold a defined role.

***

### Demo dApp:

**Best for:** Quick integrations and SDK demos

A [lean, minimal template](https://demo.trustlesswork.com) that integrates directly with our SDK. Perfect for understanding the escrow lifecycle, testing role-based flows, and experimenting with wallet and transaction logic.\
Includes prebuilt types, hooks, and providers to help you go from zero to escrow in minutes.

### Escrow Viewer:&#x20;

**Best for:** Viewing and verifying on-chain escrows

A read-only interface for Testnet and Mainnet that lets anyone input a contract ID (escrow ID) and visualize its data in a structured way‚Äîroles, milestones, balances, and current status.\
It provides transparency for live escrows and serves as an open-source example of how to fetch and display escrow data from the Stellar RPC.[ LINK](https://viewer.trustlesswork.com)
