# Project Manager Flow (Dashboard dApp)

The Project Manager is the operational actor responsible for keeping investors informed and ensuring milestones progress through the Trustless Work escrow lifecycle.\
They do **not** deploy contracts, configure token sales, or manage investor flows.\
Their core responsibility is simple and crucial:

👉 **Update milestones and provide evidence of real-world progress.**

This ensures that Approvers and Release Signers can confidently authorize releases and that investors have transparent visibility throughout the project’s execution.

***

## **5.1 Responsibilities of the Project Manager**

The Project Manager is responsible for:

* Tracking real-world project progress
* Posting milestone updates with supporting evidence
* Communicating status changes as milestones become ready for review
* Ensuring clarity, transparency, and documentation for Approvers, Release Signers, and investors
* Maintaining auditability through the Project Dashboard

They do **not** sign releases; they prepare and document milestones so other roles can approve them.

***

## **5.2 Where the Project Manager Works**

The Project Manager only uses one dApp:

#### **📘 Project Dashboard**

All milestone-related actions happen here:

* Upload images, documents, receipts
* Add commentary and contextual notes
* Mark a milestone as “Ready for Approval”
* Track release history and escrow balance
* Verify when a release has gone through

This centralizes communication and prevents off-chain confusion or inconsistent documentation.

***

## **5.3 Step-by-Step Project Manager Flow**

***

### **Step 1 — Log Into the Project Dashboard**

The Project Manager logs in with their wallet and lands directly on the active project’s dashboard.

Here they see:

* Project overview
* Milestone list
* Current statuses
* Evidence already submitted
* Escrow balance + progress viewer

**Goal:** Understand what’s pending and what needs updating.

***

### **Step 2 — Select a Milestone to Update**

For each milestone, the Dashboard displays:

* Milestone name
* Percent or amount of associated release
* Status:
  * Not started
  * In progress
  * Ready for approval
  * Approved
  * Released
* Evidence history

The Manager clicks _Update_ on the relevant milestone.

***

### **Step 3 — Upload Evidence**

The Manager can upload:

* Photos (e.g., shipment photos, construction snapshots, warehouse receipts)
* PDF documents (invoices, bills of lading, customs forms)
* Notes and commentary explaining progress

This evidence builds trust for:

* Approvers
* Release Signers
* Investors

**The entire escrow lifecycle becomes auditable because all evidence is anchored to each milestone.**

***

### **Step 4 — Mark Milestone as “Ready for Approval”**

Once sufficient evidence has been submitted, the Manager toggles the milestone to:

#### **“Ready for Approval”**

This triggers:

* A visual change in the Backoffice (Approver sees an actionable item)
* A status update visible to investors
* A clear workflow handoff to the Approver and Release Signer

**Goal:** Signal that the milestone can now move to validation.

***

### **Step 5 — Monitor Approval & Release Progress**

The Manager now monitors the escrow flow:

#### Approver:

* Reviews evidence
* Provides signature approving milestone

#### Release Signer:

* Executes release signature
* USDC is released from the escrow to the project owner

The Manager sees these updates in real time inside the Dashboard.

***

### **Step 6 — Add Additional Evidence (Optional)**

During long-running milestones, the Manager can repeatedly upload progress updates.

Examples:

* Equipment has shipped
* Customs clearance completed
* Field deployment in progress
* Verification certificate received

This transparency boosts investor confidence and creates a full audit trail.

***

### **Step 7 — Milestone Completion**

Once the Release Signer completes the release:

* The milestone status updates automatically
* The escrow viewer displays the corresponding release event
* Investors see proof of capital movement
* Manager continues with next milestone

When all milestones are completed, the project transitions into **vault setup** (handled by the Project Creator).

## **5.5 Why This Role Matters**

The Project Manager is the bridge between **real-world progress** and **on-chain trust**.

Their updates ensure:

* Milestones are backed by evidence
* Approvers and Signers can operate confidently
* Investors can verify transparency at all times
* The project moves smoothly from milestone to milestone

This role is the heartbeat of the tokenized private credit system — creating the credibility and auditability that allow trustless capital flows.
