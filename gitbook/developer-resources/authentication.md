# Authentication

In order to get registered,  you have to connect with a Stellar wallet. If you do not yet have one, or have never used one, there is more information in the following section:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../stellar-and-soroban-the-backbone-of-trustless-work/stellar-wallets/" %}
[stellar-wallets](../stellar-and-soroban-the-backbone-of-trustless-work/stellar-wallets/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

To authenticate you will need to login to our Dapp with a Stellar Wallet and Request an API key. Here are the steps to achieve that:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="request-api-key.md" %}
[request-api-key.md](request-api-key.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Coming:** \
We are figuring out how this can work with passkeys and send to addresses with Memo. \
WE do this in the open, so feel free to crontribute. [community.md](../community-and-roadmap/community.md "mention")
