# Request Api Key

The first step is to register in our dApp, in order to be able to have an user and get our API Key. Here's the link to our DApp:&#x20;

In order to get registered,  you have to connect with a Stellar wallet. If you do not yet have one, or have never used one, there is more information in the following section:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../stellar-wallets/" %}
[stellar-wallets](../../stellar-wallets/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once you have a wallet, the login process is straightforward. Just go to dapp.trustlesswork.com, and click login, this should ask for a signature and then you are in! \

Once logged in, you should complete your profile, and then request the API Key.

You must have at least the **use case** filled, if not, the system won't give you the API Key.
