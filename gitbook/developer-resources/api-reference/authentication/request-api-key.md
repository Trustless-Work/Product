In order to get registered,  you have to connect with a Stellar wallet. If you do not yet have one, or have never used one, there is more information in the following section:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../essential-tools-for-developers/stellar-wallets/" %}
[stellar-wallets](../../essential-tools-for-developers/stellar-wallets/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once you have a wallet, the login process is straightforward. Just go to dapp.trustlesswork.com, and click login, this should ask for a signature and then you are in! \

You must have at least the **use case** filled, if not, the system won't give you the API Key.
