# Request API Key

API keys can be requested in our dApp. You will require a Stellar wallet. If you do not yet have one, or have never used one, there is more information in the following section:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../../stellar-and-soroban-the-backbone-of-trustless-work/stellar-wallets/" %}
[stellar-wallets](../../../stellar-and-soroban-the-backbone-of-trustless-work/stellar-wallets/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Login with your wallet login to our dApp. You will have to sign to login. This will create a user profile. Here's the link to our dApp:&#x20;

In the dApp landing, you'll find a section called **"API Key for Authentication"**. Here you'll see the best explanation in order to get the API Key.



If you are using api.trustlesswork.com (mainnet)

{% embed url="https://dapp.trustlesswork.com" %}

If you are using api.dev.trustlesswork.com (testnet)

{% embed url="https://dapp.dev.trustlesswork.com" %}

Once logged in, you should complete your profile, and then request the API Key.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must have at least the **use case** filled, if not, the system won't give you the API Key.
{% endhint %}

And that's it. If you have any issue, please fill the form of "Report and Issue".
