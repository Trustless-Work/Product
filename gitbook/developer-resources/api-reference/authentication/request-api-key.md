# Request Api Key

API keys can be requested in our Dapp. You will require a Stellar wallet. If you do not yet have one, or have never used one, there is more information in the following section:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../../technology-overview/tools-and-utilities/stellar-wallets/" %}
[stellar-wallets](../../../technology-overview/tools-and-utilities/stellar-wallets/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Login with your wallet login to our Dapp. You will have to sign to login. This will create a user profile. Here's the link to our DApp:&#x20;

You must have at least the **use case** filled, if not, the system won't give you the API Key.
