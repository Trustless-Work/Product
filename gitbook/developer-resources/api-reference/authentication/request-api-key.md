# Request API Key

API keys can be requested in our dApp. You will require a Stellar wallet. If you do not yet have one, or have never used one, there is more information in the following section:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../../stellar-and-soroban-the-backbone-of-trustless-work/stellar-wallets/" %}
[stellar-wallets](../../../stellar-and-soroban-the-backbone-of-trustless-work/stellar-wallets/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Login with your wallet login to our dApp. You will have to sign to login. This will create a user profile. Here's the link to our dApp:&#x20;

In the dApp landing, you'll find a section called **"API Key for Authentication"**. Here you'll see the best explanation in order to get the API Key.

Once logged in, you should complete your profile, and then request the API Key. You can do this in the “settings” section of the dApp. Please note that the API key you generate can only be viewed once. Once you leave the “settings” section, you will no longer be able to see it. So be sure to copy it and save it carefully.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must have at least the **use case** filled, if not, the system won't give you the API Key.
{% endhint %}
