### **What this Endpoint returns?**

This endpoint returns the transaction unsigned so that the transaction can be signed by means of a customer wallet.

### Use Example:

```typescript
import axios from "axios";

const http = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://dev.api.trustlesswork.com",
  timeout: 10000,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer your_api_key`,
  },
});

export const useExample = async () => {
    // Get the signer address
    const { address } = await kit.getAddress();

    const response = await http.put(
      "/escrow/single-release/update-escrow",
      {
        // body requested for the endpoint
      },
    ); 
    
    // Get the unsigned transaction hash
    const { unsignedTransaction } = response.data;

    // Sign the transaction by wallet
    const { signedTxXdr } = await signTransaction(unsignedTransaction, {
      address,
      networkPassphrase: WalletNetwork.TESTNET,
    });

    // Send the transaction to Stellar Network
    const tx = await http.post("/helper/send-transaction", {
      signedXdr: signedTxXdr,
    });

    const { data } = tx;

    return data;
}
```
