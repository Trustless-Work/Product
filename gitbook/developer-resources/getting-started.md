### 🚀 What Is Trustless Work?

Trustless Work is an Escrow-as-a-Service (EaaS) platform designed for the stablecoin economy. It lets you securely hold funds in non-custodial smart contracts until milestones are completed and approved.

Use it to:

* Lock funds with programmable milestone logic
* Enable transparent fund releases for services, grants, rentals, etc.
* Automate fund flows using signer-based roles

### 🧪 Quickstart — Deploy Your First Escrow

▶ [Try the Demo](https://demo.trustlesswork.com/) — No code required

#### Pre-requisites

* [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) wallet
* Testnet USDC + XLM ([Get test tokens](https://docs.trustlesswork.com/tools-and-utilities/testnet-tokens))

#### Step-by-Step

1. Open the [demo app](https://demo.trustlesswork.com/)
2. Fill in escrow details (roles, milestones)
3. Click deploy → sign the transaction
4. Send testmet USDC to the escrow contract address
5. Mark, approve, and release milestones from the UI

***

### ✍️ 2. Design Your Escrow Lifecycle

Before deploying, define:

* Who can **mark milestones** as done
* Who must **approve work**
* Who can **release funds**
* Who can **resolve disputes**

→ [Escrow Roles & Permissions](../technology-overview/roles-in-trustless-work.md)

### 📬 API Overview

Get your API key in our dApp: \
[request-api-key.md](api-reference/authentication/request-api-key.md "mention")

The Trustless Work API is your gateway to deploy and manage decentralized smart escrows on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts. All interactions return unsigned XDRs, which must be signed client-side using the wallet associated with the correct role.

### 🧠 React SDK Integration

NPM: [`@trustless-work/escrow`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trustless-work/escrow)

```bash
npm i @trustless-work/escrow

```

#### Provider Setup

```tsx
import {
  TrustlessWorkConfig,
  development, // or mainNet
} from "@trustless-work/escrow";

export function TrustlessWorkProvider({ children }) {
  const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY || "";
  return (
    <TrustlessWorkConfig baseURL={development} apiKey={apiKey}>
      {children}
    </TrustlessWorkConfig>
  );
}

```

#### Wrap your app:

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <TrustlessWorkProvider>
          {children}
        </TrustlessWorkProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

```

> Once wrapped, you can use the SDK's escrow hooks and mutation functions across your app.

### 🔑 Wallets & Passkeys

Every role (marker, approver, releaser, etc.) needs a Stellar-Soroban compatible wallet.

Supported wallets:

* [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/)
* [Passkey Wallets](https://docs.trustlesswork.com/tools-and-utilities/passkey-wallets) _(biometric, contract-based)_

***

### 🔁 Escrow Lifecycle Explained

1. **Initiation** – Define roles, asset, and milestones
2. **Funding** – Deposit stablecoins (USDC) into the contract
3. **Milestone Marked** – Provider marks progress
4. **Approval** – Client or approver signs off
5. **Release** – Funds are released
6. **Dispute** – Optional: Resolver steps in

> Each action requires a signature from the assigned wallet address.
