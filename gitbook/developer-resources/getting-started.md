# 🚀 Developer Quickstart

### 🚀 What Is Trustless Work?

Trustless Work is an Escrow-as-a-Service (EaaS) platform designed for the stablecoin economy. It lets you securely hold funds in non-custodial smart contracts until milestones are completed and approved.

Use it to:

* Lock funds with programmable milestone logic
* Enable transparent fund releases for services, grants, rentals, etc.
* Automate fund flows using signer-based roles

### 🧪 Quickstart — Deploy Your First Escrow

▶ [Try the Demo](https://demo.trustlesswork.com/) — No code required

#### Pre-requisites

* [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) wallet
* Testnet USDC + XLM ([Get test tokens](https://docs.trustlesswork.com/tools-and-utilities/testnet-tokens))

#### Step-by-Step

1. Open the [demo app](https://demo.trustlesswork.com/)
2. Fill in escrow details (roles, milestones)
3. Click deploy → sign the transaction
4. Send testmet USDC to the escrow contract address
5. Mark, approve, and release milestones from the UI

***

### ✍️ 2. Design Your Escrow Lifecycle

Before deploying, define:

* Who can **mark milestones** as done
* Who must **approve work**
* Who can **release funds**
* Who can **resolve disputes**

→ [Escrow Roles & Permissions](../technology-overview/roles-in-trustless-work.md)

Not sure how to structure it? → Check example flows

### 🧰 3. Deploy and Test on Our dApps

We’ve built a lightweight dApp to help you deploy escrows without writing code.

➡️ [**Launch dApp**](http://dapp.trustlesswork.com/)

**Before you start:**

* Install a [Stellar Wallet](../tools-and-utilities/stellar-wallets/) (Freighter, xBull, etc.)
* Grab testnet[ XLM & USDC](../tools-and-utilities/testnet-tokens.md)
