# 🚀 Developer Quickstart

### 🧠 1. Understand the Model (Optional but Recommended)

Trustless Work is an **Escrow-as-a-Service** platform that lets you securely hold funds in a programmable, non-custodial escrow until milestones are completed and approved.

✅ Why it matters:

* 🚀 Launch escrow flows in minutes, not months
* 🔐 Secure, neutral, role-based fund control
* 💸 Save on dev effort and avoid smart contract audits
* 🌍 Enable global, stablecoin-based payments using Stellar + USDC

📚 [Read how it works](../technology-overview/)\
📖 [Explore use cases](../use-cases-unlocking-the-potential-of-smart-escrows/)

***

### ✍️ 2. Design Your Escrow Lifecycle

Before deploying, define:

* Who can **mark milestones** as done
* Who must **approve work**
* Who can **release funds**
* Who can **resolve disputes**

→ [Escrow Roles & Permissions](../technology-overview/roles-in-trustless-work.md)

Not sure how to structure it? → Check example flows

### 🧰 3. Deploy and Test on Our dApps

We’ve built a lightweight dApp to help you deploy escrows without writing code.

➡️ [**Launch dApp**](http://dapp.trustlesswork.com/)

**Before you start:**

* Install a [Stellar Wallet](../tools-and-utilities/stellar-wallets/) (Freighter, xBull, etc.)
* Grab testnet[ XLM & USDC](../tools-and-utilities/testnet-tokens.md)
