# Who Should Use This

Trustless Work is built for developers, platforms, and agents who want **more control and automation** over when funds are released.

### Platforms using stablecoins

Examples:

* Gig and freelance platforms (milestone payouts)
* B2B tools using USDC for global settlement
* Rental and booking platforms (security deposits)

Why it fits:

* Reduce fraud
* Automate releases and disbursements
* Lower operational cost

### Builders and product teams

Examples:

* Solo devs or small teams prototyping dApps
* DAO tooling, donation platforms, on-chain marketplaces

Why it fits:

* Plug-and-play escrow logic
* Start on testnet, then go live without re-architecting

### Enterprise use

Examples:

* Platforms with escrow-like flows but no escrow infrastructure
* Teams replacing costly custodial services with on-chain escrow

Why it fits:

* Less legal and operational risk than custody
* Programmable, auditable escrow behavior
