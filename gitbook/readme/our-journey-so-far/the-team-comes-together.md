#### **The First Call**

On our first call, Alberto pitched the initial idea for Trustless Work and shared an exciting opportunity: the application for the [**Astro Hacker House**](https://draperuniversity.com/stellar) program by Draper University. The team immediately recognized the potential and decided to target this program as their first milestone.

**🎯 A Shared Goal**\
From the beginning, their focus was clear: build a solution that could get into Astro Hacker House, refine the idea, and set the foundation for something transformative.

#### **The Beginning of a Shared Vision**

With a clear problem to solve and a team aligned on the mission, Trustless Work began to take shape. This was no longer just an idea—it was a collaboration fueled by a shared belief in the power of blockchain to simplify and secure payments.\
