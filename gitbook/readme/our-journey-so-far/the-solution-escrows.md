# 💡 The Solution: Escrows

With a great problem identified and a motivated team in place, it was time to explore the solution. Alberto presented his research and findings, laying the foundation for what would become Trustless Work.

#### **The Core Idea**

Escrows have long been a trusted mechanism for securing payments, but traditional systems are inefficient, costly, and inaccessible for smaller contracts.
