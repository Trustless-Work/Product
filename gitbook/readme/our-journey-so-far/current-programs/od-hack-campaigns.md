# 💻 OD Hack Campaigns

The [**OD Hack #10 campaign**](https://app.onlydust.com/hackathons/odhack-10) was a significant success, bringing new contributors and advancing our product.

#### **What is OnlyDust?** 🌐

**OnlyDust** is a platform that connects open-source contributors with projects in need of development. It fosters collaboration within the web3 ecosystem by providing funding, mentorship, and tools for decentralized teams.

**Why It Matters**:

* OnlyDust empowers developers to work on impactful blockchain projects like Trustless Work.
* Through hackathons and campaigns, it helps projects scale while nurturing a thriving developer community.

***

**Key Achievements**:

* **🤝 First Contributors**: Onboarded developers who contributed to our Smart Contracts and Escrow UI, laying a solid foundation for future iterations.
* **🛠️ Integration by Other Teams**: Four teams using Trustless Work’s API also benefited from contributors and funding, helping them grow alongside us.
* **📋 Issue Assignments**: A total of **58 issues** (across Trustless Work and related projects) were completed, showcasing strong developer engagement.

**Escrow UI Development**:\
During OD Hack #10, we built the first version of our **Escrow UI**—a form-based interface enabling developers to:

* Fill in escrow details.
* Visualize how contracts are created.

***

**Looking Ahead to OD Hack #11**:

* **🛠️ Developer Mode**: Introducing a new feature allowing developers to see how API requests are constructed as they interact with the UI.
* **📈 Simplifying Integration**: This enhancement will make it easier for developers to implement our solutions in real-world use cases.
