### **A Firsthand Encounter with the Problem**

#### 👨‍💻**Personal Experience in Product Agency**

Alberto, the founder of Trustless Work, encountered these challenges while running a digital product agency. The pain points were clear: traditional payment models were unreliable, inefficient, and costly.

#### 🔄**Client & Service Provider Dual Role**

Acting as both a client for Argentine development teams and a service provider for U.S.-based clients revealed a flawed system, including:

* ⏳**Payment Delays**: Long waiting periods created cash flow crunches.
* 💰**Upfront Costs**: High initial payments were risky for clients and service providers alike.
* ⚙️**Inefficient Models**: The typical payment structure—50% upfront and 50% upon delivery—left both sides vulnerable.

#### 🌎**Validation of the Problem**

Alberto’s insights were validated while engaging with other agencies during a pop-up city in Buenos Aires. It became evident that these challenges weren’t unique—they were systemic.
