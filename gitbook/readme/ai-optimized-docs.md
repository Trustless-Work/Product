# AI optimized docs

Trustless Work docs are written for humans **and** for machines.

Humans get clarity, precision, and examples. Agents get structure, consistency, and predictable semantics.

### Why this matters

The next generation of builders won’t just code. They’ll prompt, automate, and delegate work to agents.

An AI-ready doc set lets you:

* Export content for training and internal copilots.
* Feed pages into your LLM memory or RAG pipeline.
* Let agents reason through flows and generate SDK/API calls.

{% hint style="info" %}
Goal: make the documentation itself a building block for automation.
{% endhint %}

### Export formats

You can export any section of the docs as PDF or Markdown.

* **PDF** for onboarding manuals and reference packs.
* **Markdown (.md)** for ingestion and context injection.
* **Prompt blocks** for pasting into GPT, Cursor, or v0.dev.

{% hint style="success" %}
Check the SDK pages for prompt-first workflows that generate and debug escrow flows.
{% endhint %}

### Ask the docs (search)

Search is optimized for natural language. Use intent-focused prompts, not just keywords.

Example prompts:

```
fund a multi-release escrow with testnet USDC
create an SDK snippet to mark milestone as done
explain the difference between approver and release signer
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Search rewrites your question into a structured query and returns the best snippets.
{% endhint %}
