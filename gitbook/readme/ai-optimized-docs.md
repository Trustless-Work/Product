# AI optimized docs

Trustless Work documentation isn’t just written for humans.\
It’s **structured for agents, copilots, and AI models** to understand, remix, and build on top of.

***

Every page in our documentation is written for both:

* **Humans** who want clarity, precision, and examples.
* **Machines** that need structure, consistency, and semantics.

***

#### Why It Matters

The next generation of builders won’t just code — they’ll **prompt**.\
Trustless Work is optimized for that.\
Our docs follow an **AI-ready format**, meaning you can:

* Export any page in **Markdown or PDF** for training datasets.
* Feed it directly into your **custom copilot or LLM memory**.
* Let your AI agents read the docs, **reason through flows**, and even **execute API calls** using your keys and roles.

> 🧠 Our goal: make the documentation itself a building block for automation.

***

#### Export & Train

You can export any section of this documentation into:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **PDF** – for reference and onboarding manuals
* **Markdown (.md)** – for AI ingestion or context injection
* **Prompt blocks** – pre-formatted snippets that can be pasted into GPT, Cursor, or v0.dev

> 💡 Use the SDK subpage under VibeCoding to see live examples of AI prompts generating, debugging, and deploying escrow flows automatically.

***

#### Ask the Docs

The docs themselves are **AI-trained and search-optimized**.\
That means the search bar understands **natural language and intent** — not just keywords.

Try prompts like:

```
fund a multi-release escrow with testnet USDC
create an SDK snippet to mark milestone as done
explain the difference between approver and release signer
```

> The system will reformat your question into a structured query, returning optimized snippets, SDK calls, or workflow examples.
