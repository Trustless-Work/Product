# Architecture & Design Strategy

#### Building Hybrid — The Power of Decentralized Foundations

Most platforms don’t need to “go fully on-chain.”\
What they need is **programmable trust**—a neutral, verifiable layer that handles what matters most: custody, release logic, and auditability.

That’s what Trustless Work provides.\
We let you decide _how decentralized_ you want to go — from a quick no-code back office setup to a fully automated, API-driven architecture.

***

#### ⚙️ How Decentralization Fits In

Traditional escrows live in someone else’s infrastructure — you trust the platform or a third-party agent to hold and release funds.\
In Trustless Work, the **escrow itself is the infrastructure**.\
Each one is an independent smart contract that holds logic, roles, and balances directly on the Stellar blockchain.

This design gives you:

* **Transparency** — anyone can verify the escrow in real time.
* **Composability** — you can plug this logic into your own stack.
* **Control** — you decide how much you abstract or automate.

#### 🧩 The Trustless Work Architecture

| Layer                        | Tool                                   | What It Does                                                      | Typical User                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **1. Smart Contract Layer**  | **Soroban Escrow Contract**            | Core logic for milestones, roles, and fund releases.              | Everyone — the foundation    |
| **2. Integration Layer**     | **Escrow API & SDK**                   | Programmatic control from your backend or frontend.               | Developers                   |
| **3. Interaction Layer**     | **Back Office dApp**                   | Visual control panel for creating, funding, and managing escrows. | Ops, admins, non-dev teams   |
| **4. Transparency Layer**    | **Escrow Viewer**                      | Public, read-only audit tool for contracts on testnet or mainnet. | Compliance, users, investors |
| **5. Experimentation Layer** | **Demo Lab dApp**                      | Sandbox for learning and rapid testing.                           | Builders, hackathons         |
| **6. Automation Layer**      | **AI Agents / Webhooks (coming soon)** | Automate milestone checks, approvals, or payouts.                 | Advanced users               |

Each tool works **independently**, but connects seamlessly through the same escrow contracts and API logic.

#### 🧱 Hybrid Implementation Models

Not every company will deploy the entire stack.\
That’s why Trustless Work is **hybrid by design** — you can start manual, add automation later, or plug in your own UI at any time.

**1. Back Office–First**

Launch without writing code.\
Use the Back Office to deploy escrows, define roles, and manage releases.\
Then embed escrow status widgets or Viewer links on your own landing pages.

→ _Best for pilots, MVPs, or early marketplaces._

***

**2. Hybrid API + Back Office**

Create escrows through the API (from your app),\
but handle approvals or disputes in the Back Office.\
Combine your UX with our governance layer.

→ _Best for platforms that want control, without managing every on-chain flow._

***

**3. Transparency Add-On**

Keep your existing payment flow,\
but connect your users to the Escrow Viewer for proof-of-funds and progress tracking.

→ _Best for compliance-heavy or high-trust environments._

***

**4. Template Fork**

Fork the Demo dApp or Back Office,\
rebrand it, integrate your wallet provider or custom logic, and ship fast.

→ _Best for startups or teams that want to own the UI but use our underlying logic._

***

#### 🌍 Example Hybrid Flow

**Scenario:** A freelance marketplace wants to add milestone-based payments.

* They deploy escrows in the **Back Office**.
* Use their own **frontend** (built in Next.js) to list jobs and show milestone progress.
* Embed the **Escrow Viewer** link for each job to give users transparent proof-of-funds.
* When ready to scale, they integrate the **API** to automate escrow creation and releases.

No blockchain devs. No audits. Just composable infrastructure.

***

#### 🧠 Why This Architecture Wins

* **Decentralization = Independence**\
  You’re not locked into a vendor or a custodial middleman.\
  The contract exists on-chain, and your users can verify it anytime.
* **Hybrid = Speed**\
  You can start no-code and move to code later.\
  Back Office today, API tomorrow — same logic, same escrows.
* **Transparency = Trust**\
  The Viewer turns every transaction into a live proof-of-funds page.\
  Users don’t have to take your word — they can see the escrow themselves.

***

#### 💡 Key Takeaway

Trustless Work isn’t just an escrow API — it’s an **architecture for programmable trust.**\
You can centralize your UX while decentralizing your money flow.\
You can use our Back Office as your admin layer, the Viewer as your transparency layer,\
and the API as your automation layer — all connected to the same on-chain contracts.

> **You own the experience.**\
> **The blockchain owns the trust.**
