# ⛓️ Open-Source Escrow Smart Contracts

**Trustless Work** is built on a foundation of **open-source escrow smart contracts**, providing a **trustless, transparent, and programmable** backbone for handling funds. These contracts are deployed on **Soroban**, Stellar's smart contract platform, and are designed to ensure that escrows are executed securely, fairly, and without intermediaries.

### **What Are Open-Source Escrow Smart Contracts?**

**Escrow Smart Contracts** are programmable agreements that securely manage and release funds based on predefined actions. They replace the traditional need for a custodian, like a bank, and allow participants to play an active role in the Escrow Lifecycle.&#x20;

#### **Key Features**

1. **Trustless Transactions** 🌐
   * The **smart contracts** manage funds transparently. Once deployed there are only specific flows the escrow can take. Escrow status can be updated only by explicit participants, addresess that are assigned roles, during the deployment stage.
2. **Transparency and Security** 🔒
   * As **open-source** contracts, they are fully auditable by anyone. Participants can review every line of code to understand exactly how their funds will be handled.
   * Deployed on **Soroban** (Stellar's blockchain for smart contracts), they benefit from blockchain's inherent **security**—making them **tamper-proof** and resistant to unauthorized changes.
3. **Flexible and Programmable Conditions** ⚙️
   * The contracts can be configured to suit a wide variety of use cases. Conditions such as **milestone completions**, **multi-party sign-offs**, or **specific timelines** can all be encoded in the smart contracts.
   * Whether it’s milestone payments for freelancers, security deposits for rentals, or crowdfunding releases, our smart contracts provide **flexible configuration** to fit your needs.

#### **Benefits of Using Our Smart Contracts**

* **No Intermediaries Required**: Traditional escrows depend on trusted third parties, which come with **delays** and **fees**. Our **smart contracts** act as the neutral party, eliminating the costs and delays associated with human involvement.
* **Global and Accessible**: Leveraging the **Stellar Network**, our escrow contracts support **fast and low-cost transactions** in assets like **USDC**, making them accessible across borders with minimal fees compared to traditional systems.
* **Fully Open Source**: By being **open-source**, developers and users can review and contribute to the code. This fosters **community trust** and allows for continuous improvements by developers worldwide.

#### **How They Fit Into Trustless Work's Ecosystem**

* **Trustless Work API Integration**: The **Trustless Work API** interacts directly with these **smart contracts**, abstracting away blockchain complexities and allowing developers to integrate escrows without needing deep blockchain knowledge.
* **Open-Source Templates**: To make it even easier, we provide **open-source templates** that work with these contracts to speed up the implementation process for common use cases—helping you get started quickly with **minimal coding**.

#### **Why Soroban?**

* **Built on Stellar**: Our **smart contracts** are deployed using **Soroban**, Stellar’s innovative smart contract platform that offers scalability, **low fees**, and **high security**.
* **Modern and Efficient**: **Soroban** uses **Rust**, a modern language known for its **security** and efficiency, ensuring that our contracts are robust, fast, and secure—crucial attributes for handling financial transactions.
