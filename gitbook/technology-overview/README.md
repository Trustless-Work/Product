# ⚒️ Understanding Smart Escrows

Trustless Work enables programmable, non-custodial escrows tailored to any workflow. This section merges conceptual understanding with practical design tools, helping you move from theory to implementation.

***

#### 🔎 What is a Smart Escrow?

A Smart Escrow is a blockchain-based smart contract that holds funds until specific conditions are met. It is trustless, programmable, and transparent by design.

* 📅 **Set Up**: Define roles, amounts, and milestone logic
* 💳 **Fund**: Lock stablecoins (USDC, XLM) on-chain
* ✅ **Execute**: Release funds only when verified conditions are met

Trustless Work escrows are:

* 🔒 **Non-Custodial**
* 🚀 **Fast & Low-Cost** (on Stellar/Soroban)
* ⚖️ **Transparent & Programmable**
