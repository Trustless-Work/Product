The diagram above illustrates the architecture of Trustless Work, showing how each component interacts to make **Smart Escrows** possible.

* **Trustless Work API** provides an interface for developers and platforms to easily initialize, configure, fund, and manage escrows. With simple API calls, integration becomes intuitive and hassle-free.
* **Stellar Network: Trustless Work** is built on the Stellar Network. Escrows work by assigning roles to addresses, these addresses are on the Stellar Network. Stellar wallets are required to sign transaccions and send/receive funds.&#x20;
* **Open-Source Escrow Smart Contracts** form the **trustless foundation** of our system. Deployed on **Soroban**, Stellar‚Äôs smart contract platform, these contracts ensure that funds are securely managed and only released once conditions are met‚Äîoffering transparency and tamper-proof execution.

* **Open-Source Templates & Developer Tools** are designed to assist developers in integrating **Smart Escrows** quickly. These templates are customizable, helping you transform your vision into functionality without the friction of building everything from scratch.

Together, these components allow developers to focus on building great products without the worry of complex payment flows or third-party dependencies.
