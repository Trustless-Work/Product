# Escrow products Mix & Match Guide

Designing an escrow is only half the battle. The real question is:\
**How do you go from schema to a working product without burning months on contracts, audits, and ops flows?**

That’s why Trustless Work offers a **modular product suite** — tools you can combine like building blocks to launch escrow-powered workflows today.

***

### The Product Suite

* **Escrow API** – The programmable core. Create, fund, update, approve, and release escrows. Maximum control, minimal friction.
* **Next.js SDK** – React-friendly wrapper for interacting with escrows directly from your frontend.
* **Escrow Blocks** – Pre-built React UI components. The fastest way to launch a user-facing escrow flow.
* **Back Office dApp (Open Source)** – Ops-friendly control panel for deploying and managing escrows. Ideal for dispute resolution, MVP pilots, and non-technical teams. Use it, clone it.
* **Demo Lab dApp** – Developer sandbox to test flows before pushing to production.
* **Escrow Viewer (Open Source)** – Public, read-only explorer of escrow configs, milestones, and balances. Essential for transparency and compliance.

### Integration Models

Think of these as **playbooks** for how to mix & match the suite:

1. **Full API/SDK Integration**\
   → For teams with dev capacity and UX control needs.\
   Your UI + our escrow logic.
2. **Escrow Blocks:** \
   → Import template UI components to launch faster, with minimal custom frontend work.
3. **Hybrid Back Office**\
   → Your users stay in your UI, but ops/disputes handled in the Back Office.
4. **Back Office First**\
   → Launch this week. Manage flows directly in our Back Office while validating.
5. **Template Fork**\
   → Clone one of our open-source dApps, rebrand, extend. Perfect for hackathons.
