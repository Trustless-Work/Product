{% hint style="info" %}
This explanation is for the Multiple-release type of contract (to be available soon). The single release is very similar, just that there is only one release if and only if all milestones are approved.&#x20;

The Milestone Status Update Phase is where the **Milestone Marker** signals progress by marking a milestone as completed. This step is critical for keeping all participants informed about the transaction's progress and prepares the milestone for review by the **Milestone Approver** in the subsequent Approval Phase.

***

#### **Key Actions**

**1. Milestone Marker Updates Milestone Status**

* The **Milestone Marker** logs into the platform or uses the Trustless Work API to update the milestone status to **For Review**, he signs the transaction, signaling the completion of the deliverable.

**2. Escrow Contract Updates**

* Upon the signed update, the escrow contract:
  * Changes the milestone status to **For Review**.
  * Retains the **Approved Flag** as `False` until explicitly approved or disputed by the **Milestone Approver**.

**3. Notification to Milestone Approver**

* The platform detects the status update and notifies the **Milestone Approver** that the milestone is ready for review.

**4. Transparency for All Participants**

* All participants, including the **Milestone Marker**, **Release Signer**, and **Platform Address**, can view the updated milestone status:
  * On-chain via the transaction ID or Stellar block explorer.
  * Through the **Escrow Viewer** or by querying the Trustless Work API.
