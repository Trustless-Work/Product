# Dispute Resolution

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Dispute Resolution Phase is triggered when either the client or the service provider raises a dispute. This phase involves a review by the designated dispute resolver (e.g., the platform, Marketplace) to determine how the funds should be allocated. The escrow contract remains in a locked state, with no funds released, until the dispute is resolved.

#### **Key Actions**

1. **Raising a Dispute:**
   * The client (or Service Provider) identifies issues with the milestone deliverable and raises a dispute.
   * Evidence or supporting documentation (e.g., screenshots, contracts, delivery notes) is submitted to the dispute resolver (As a URL)
   * The escrow contract updates:
     * **Milestone Status:** Set to **In Dispute.**
     * **Dispute Flag:** Updated to reflect the dispute status.
2. **Dispute Resolver Review:**
   * The dispute resolver (Marketplace) reviews the case, including:
     * Evidence provided by the client.
     * Responses or counter-evidence from the service provider (Bob).
   * The resolver makes a decision on fund allocation (e.g., full refund to client, partial payment to service provider).
3. **Escrow Contract Updates:**
   * Based on the resolver’s decision, the escrow contract is called for the release with:
     * **Funds for Service Provider:** Amount to be sent to service provider
     * **Funds for Client:** Amount to be sent back to the client
4. **Sign and Release:**
   * The resolver signs the resolution, releasing payment as set and setting the released flag to TRUE
