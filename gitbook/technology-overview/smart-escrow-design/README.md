To simplify the design process, we have subdivided the escrow lifecycle into distinct phases. Click on any phase to learn more:

[Initiation phase](../escrow-lifecycle/initiation-phase.md)

[Funding phase](../escrow-lifecycle/funding-phase.md)

[Milestone Status Updates](../escrow-lifecycle/milestone-status-update.md)

[Approval phase](../escrow-lifecycle/approval-phase.md)

[Release phase](../escrow-lifecycle/release-phase.md)

[Dispute Resolution phase](../escrow-lifecycle/dispute-resolution.md)

Each phase plays a crucial role in the lifecycle, and each participating party has one or more defined roles.

To understand how roles interact accross the lifecycle, visit the [Roles in Trustless Work](../roles-in-trustless-work.md)

### Escrow Design

Start designing your escrow configurations visually using our Excalidraw or Figma (old)  template. Feel free to copy it and accelerate your Go To market by correctly planning your Trustless Work integration!
