#### ðŸŸ¢ Single-Release Escrow

**Best for:**\
Simple transactions with a one-time approval and release. Ideal for freelance jobs, digital goods, or payouts that donâ€™t require multiple steps.

**How it works:**

1. Funds are deposited once.
2. A single milestone is marked as completed.
3. Upon approval, the full amount is released.

**Why use it?**

* âœ… Fastest to integrate
* âœ… Minimal logic
* âœ… Works well for solo builders and MVPs

***

#### ðŸŸ  Multi-Release Escrow

**Best for:**\
Projects with multiple milestones, stages, or partial payoutsâ€”like grant disbursements, multi-part gigs, or staged deliveries.

**How it works:**

1. Funds can be deposited upfront or in parts.
2. Multiple milestones are marked and reviewed.
3. Funds are released incrementally as each milestone is approved.

**Why use it?**

* âœ… More control and flexibility
* âœ… Supports complex workflows
* âœ… Enables trust without overcommitting funds

### ðŸ§ª Quickstart Tips

* Use **Single-Release** to get started fast.
